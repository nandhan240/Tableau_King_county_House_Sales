# Tableau_King_county_House_Sales

In this Tableau Project, I build an interactive dashboard with a calendar widget as the main filter and multiple visuals including a line chart, histograms, a map, and a heatmap.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction.

I used TABLEAU PUBLIC to carry forward with the analysis.
